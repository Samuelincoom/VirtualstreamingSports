# VirtualstreamingSports
This is a Potential private repository for my Master's project in Software engineering at University of Gothenberg That will enable streaming of sports games LIVE on a Virtual device connected to the EyeView of the athelete..  
Imagine the immersive experience of Being able to Watch the superbowl LIVE on a virtual device where you see the game from a small camera embedded into Tom Brady's Helmet and experience all the tackles he receives through vibrations? or the helmet of Daniel Ricciardo in Formula 1??
Or in soccer, connecting this same camera to the sort of googles Edgar Davies used to wear?
This is the End-Goal of this HLS Virtual streaming Project
