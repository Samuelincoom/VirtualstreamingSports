# VirtualstreamingSports
Imagine Being able to Watch the superbowl LIVE in a virtual device where you see the game from camera's connected to Tom Brady's Helmet and experience all the tackles he receives through vibrations? or the helmet of Daniel Ricciardo in Formula 1??
Or in soccer, connecting this same camera to the sort of googles Edgar Davies used to wear?
This is the End-Goal of this HLS Virtual streaming Project
